let : 
	Value can be change 

const :
	Value can not change it's fix value

var : 
	Value can be change 

Note: Var Is old coding format than let keyword

for example :

1] 	if(5>2)
	{
		console.log("Inside block");
		let address = "Delhi";
		console.log("Current Address Is : ",address);		O/P :Current Address Is : Delhi
		address = "Mumbai";
		console.log("Updated Address Is : ",address);		O/P :Updated Address Is : Mumbai
	}

	console.log("Updated Address Is : ",address);			Getting Error : Address is local variable / Function Scope


2]	const address = "Mumbai";

	if(5>2)
	{
		console.log("Inside block");
		address = "Kerala";
		console.log("Updated Address Is : ",address);		Getting Error : Const variable can not assign second time it's final value	
	}


3] Var has no local scope / functional scope it behave like global scope
   Var data can be override

	if(5>2)
	{
		console.log("Inside block");
		var address = "Delhi";
		console.log("Current Address Is : ",address);		O/P :Current Address Is : Delhi			
	}

	console.log("Updated Address Is : ",address);			O/P :Updated Address Is : Delhi
		
	var x = 10;
	var x = 30;

	console.log("x value:",x);					O/P :x value:30
	console.log("Updated x value:",x);				O/P :Updated x value:30


4] 	let x = 10;
	let x = 30;

	console.log("x value:",x);					Getting Error : X has already been declared
	console.log("Updated x value:",x);
