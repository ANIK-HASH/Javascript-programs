1] Primitive Datatype	- Created In Stack memory
2] Reference Datatype  	- Created In Heap Memory

Primitive : Number , String , Boolean , Null , Undefined 
Reference : Array , Object , Date , Function

for example : 
	var a = 50;

		// To check which data type is assigned to a then
	console.log(typeof a);


let x = 3;
let y = 3;
console.log(x==y) -> true

let xa = [30];
let ya = [30];

console.log(xa==ya); -> false 

	xa contains = [23] as well heap address also like 

	Both variables address is different
